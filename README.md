Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering involves the development of sofware following the development life cycle which involves requirements gathering,design,implementation,testing,deployment and maintenance whereas traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve problems of various kinds and complete tasks.
An example of traditional programming is creating a program that uses input data and runs on a computer to provide output while software engineering is like creation of a website eg an E-Commerce platform


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Requirements gathering- This is whereby all the necessary tools required for the creation of a software are put together for instances,the resources,personnel involved etc.
Design- This involves the creation of like a prototype to see how the software is supposed to look like and make any changes wherever necessary
Implementation- This is where all the requirements gathered together with the design are put together to create the software required in terms of coding the software
Testing- The created software is then tested to see if it runs as smoothly and satisfies the requirements needed for it to fulfill and is fully functional.
Deployment is whereby after testing the software is put out in the market for use by customers
Maintenance is fixing of bugs and providing updates for the software.

Agile model uses an iterative and incremental approach and waterfall model uses a linear and sequential approach


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Agile is iterative and has an incremental approach while waterfall has more of a sequential approach.
Agile is focused on flexiblity,collaboration and customer feedback while waterfall model each phase must be completed before the next one.
Agile is iterative hence its easy to go back to the previous stage unlike waterfall which is quite rigid and difficult to go back once finished with a stage since it is sequential
Agile involves continuous delivery snce it is done in sprints while waterfall delivery can only be done after the previous stages before the delivery have been executed.
Waterfall model is preferred if the project is quite small and also for easy understanding since it is rigid to change.
Agile is preferred if theres need for changes in the development unlike waterfall which is rigid but this makes it preferrable when it comes to managing the project.
In the case of requirements engineering;
For waterfall model,the requirements are gathered before the start of the development,making any changes in the initial requirements could be quite difficult and somewhat costly,and has to be done before the next stage is executed.
Agile model,the requirements can be done in an iterative manner hence can be done at any stage and can easily accomodate changes.


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system.
Eliciting is gathering requiements from stakeholders through interviews and observations
Analyzing involves examining the eliticised requirements to ensure they are complete and feasible.
Documenting this is writing down the requirements in a simple and easy to understand manner and one can use use-case diagrams to demonstrate.
Management involves managing requirements throughout the development process.
It is important because it create a well structured,maintainable and scalable software systems

Software Design Principles;
DRY-Dont Repeat Yourself-this means the developer should avoid the duplication of code
KISS-Keep It Simple Stupid-encourages creation of simple designs to avoid unnecessary confusion and errors
Separation Of Concerns--encourages division of software systems in various sections each addressing different concerns to each other


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity is where a complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It improves maintainability and scalability of systems by facilitating easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into understandeable parts.

Testing is used to check whether the developed software system has met the requirements it was supposed to fulfill without any errors;
Unit testing involves testing individual components before integration of the system
Integration testing is testing of how various individual components that have been integratesd work together
Security testing is to ensure is safe and secure 
System testing is testing of the system as a whole
Performance testing is to test whether the performance of the system meets the criteria


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Unit testing- Tests individual components or functions of the software.Crucial because it ensures that each unit performs as expected.
Integration Testing- Tests the interactions between different modules or components.Crucial because it ensures that integrated modules work together correctly.
System Testing- Tests the entire system as a whole.Crucial because it ensures that the complete system meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing- Conducted by the end-users to validate the software against their requirements.Crucial because it ensures that the software meets user needs and is ready for deployment.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version control Systems are tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They are important because the track modifications, allow multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, and maintain a history of changes, enabling developers to reverse to previous versions if need arises.
Example;
Git
It is efficient and allows lightweight branching and merging.
Every developer has a full copy of the repository history, enhancing redundancy and offline work capabilities.
Mercurial
Has a simple and intuitive command set.
Handles large projects efficiently.
Supports complex branching and merging.


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
He/She is responsible for the planning,execution and closing of projects.Main role is to ensuring that software projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. 
Responsiblities;
Keeps the project on schedule.
Manages budget and prevents cost overruns.
Ensures the final product meets the required standards.
Efficient use of resources.
Identifies and mitigates risks.
Ensures that the needs and expectations of stakeholders are met.

Challenges;
Managing and preventing scope creep while still meeting stakeholder expectations.
Balancing resource availability with project needs and managing resource constraints.
Overcoming communication barriers, especially in distributed or remote teams.


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software maintenance involves updating and modifying software after deployment to correct defects, adapt to changes, improve performance, and prevent future issues.It is essential because it prolonges software life,enhances software performances,ensures compatibilty and improves customer satisfaction
Different types of maintenance activties;
Corrective Maintenance- To correct faults that cause the software to behave incorrectly or produce incorrect results.
Perfective Maintenance- to improve the overall performance, efficiency, and usability of the software.
Adaptive Maintenance- To ensure the software continues to operate correctly in a changing environment- easily adapt to change
Preventive Maintenance- To improve the reliability and stability of the software by anticipating and addressing potential problems before they occur.


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues faced include;
Ensuring that software used in safety-critical systems is reliable and error-free.
Maintaining honesty and integrity in professional work, including avoiding misrepresentation of capabilities or outcomes.
Avoiding plagiarism and using licensed software components.
Developing software that is secure from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.
Avoiding situations where personal interests conflict with professional responsibilities.

Software engineers can ensure they adhere by;
Participate in workshops, courses, and seminars focused on ethics in software engineering.
Maintain clear documentation of decision-making processes and ethical considerations.
Ensure that users are informed about data collection practices and how obtain their consent.
Follow best practices for software security, including regular security assessments and updates.
